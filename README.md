❤️ Support Py4GW

Hi everyone,

I'm Apo, the creator and lead developer of Py4GW.

Since 2024, Py4GW has grown from a small idea into an actively evolving open-source ecosystem. What started as a collection of tools has become a growing platform that includes Py4GW_Reforged, Py4GW_Reforged_Native, shared libraries, developer APIs, scripts, documentation, and everything needed to build on top of it.

This project is always moving forward.

Every week brings new ideas, new systems, API improvements, architectural changes, performance optimizations, reverse engineering work, compatibility updates, bug fixes, quality-of-life improvements, and new tools for developers and users alike. I'm always looking for ways to make the framework more capable, easier to use, and more enjoyable to build with.

While I'm the person leading the project and making the long-term technical decisions, Py4GW has become much more than just my work. It's a community of developers, creators, testers, contributors, and players who continue to push the project forward with ideas, feedback, code, documentation, and countless discussions.

My goal is to build the best open-source Guild Wars development framework I can, and to keep pushing it further with every release.

Everything is open source, and it always will be.

If Py4GW has helped you learn, build something you're proud of, saved you development time, or simply made Guild Wars more enjoyable, and you'd like to help support its continued evolution, you can do so through Ko-fi:

Please only donate if it's comfortably within your means. There is never any expectation or obligation to do so.

Whether you contribute financially, write code, report bugs, test new features, improve documentation, answer questions in Discord, or simply build awesome things with Py4GW, you're helping shape what this project becomes.

Thank you for being part of the journey.

Let's keep building.

# Py4GW Reforged Native

Py4GW Reforged Native is the C++ backend for Py4GW Reforged. It is a Windows
only, 32-bit DLL (`Py4GW.dll`) injected into the Guild Wars client. It is a
ground-up rework of the original Py4GW backend and replaces the retired
C++ project at https://github.com/apoguita/Py4GW_cpp_files.

Inside the game process it:

- runs its own runtime thread,
- hooks the Guild Wars Direct3D 9 render pipeline,
- hosts an embedded CPython interpreter (via pybind11),
- renders a Dear ImGui overlay and runs user Python scripts.

## The two projects

- Py4GW_Reforged_Native (this repo) - builds `Py4GW.dll`, the injected backend.
- Py4GW_Reforged - the Python library that runs inside that DLL:
  https://github.com/apoguita/Py4GW_Reforged

## Requirements

- Windows.
- A 32-bit toolchain (32-bit is mandatory; the build fails otherwise).
- CMake and Visual Studio 2022.

## Build

Using the CMake presets (output goes to ./build):

    cmake --preset vs2022-win32
    cmake --build --preset vs2022-win32-relwithdebinfo

Or plainly:

    cmake -S . -B build -A Win32
    cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo

The resulting `Py4GW.dll` is written to the repo root, next to the runtime
payload directories (`Assets/Fonts/`, `scripts/`, `offsets/`) it loads at startup, so
no copy step is needed.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch for your feature or fix.
3. Commit your changes and push the branch.
4. Open a pull request for review.
